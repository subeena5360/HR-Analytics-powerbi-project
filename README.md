Employee attrition is a critical challenge faced by many organizations, leading to increased recruitment costs, loss of talent, and disruptions in productivity. This project aims to analyze attrition trends across different departments, roles, salary levels, and demographics to identify key factors contributing to high turnover rates. Using interactive dashboards and data visualization tools, this project seeks to uncover patterns and insights related to attrition based on employee tenure, job roles, education, age, and salary. The goal is to provide data-driven recommendations to the HR and management teams to improve employee retention strategies, optimize workforce planning, and reduce attrition rates in the organization.
